# Practical Networked Applications in Rust

This is a practice Rust project from [PingCAP's training course talent
plan](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan). In particular, is an
implementation of their Practical Networked Applications in Rust project.

There's more information on the project iself, how to develop it, and run it in
the base repository. This repository is simply meant for me to keep track of my
progress and have as a showcase. There's no point in using this to copy my
solutions either, since those are already uploaded in the base repo.
